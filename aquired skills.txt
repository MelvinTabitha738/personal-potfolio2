Toggle

Toggle refers to a mechanism that alternates between two states, such as "on" and "off," or "show" and "hide." In programming, toggling is often used to change the state of an element, functionality, or setting, usually in response to user actions like clicking a button.

Example in Context:
In your JavaScript code:

javascript
Copy code
document.querySelector('.hamburger').addEventListener("click", () => {
    document.querySelector('.sidebar').classList. toggle ('sidebarGo');
});s
